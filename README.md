# Fudu Server

Fudu Server is a lightweight, educational web server project written in Python. Inspired by [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), this project aims to deepen your understanding of web servers‚Äîhow they work, what makes them performant, and how to build one from scratch.

While it started as a Python-based experiment, the long-term vision is to evolve it into a multi-language web server, pushing boundaries by incorporating modern protocols like HTTP/3 and QUIC. Whether you're an experienced developer or someone looking to dive into web server design, you're welcome to contribute and learn with us.

## üöÄ Current Features

- **Simple HTTP/1.1 Web Server**: The core of Fudu Server is a basic, Python-based HTTP/1.1 web server.
- **Multi-Worker Support**: The server runs with four workers to handle multiple client requests simultaneously, mimicking a lightweight, concurrent server architecture.

## üìÖ Future Roadmap

1. **Support for HTTP/3 and HTTP/2**: Plan to implement modern protocols such as HTTP/3 (with QUIC) and HTTP/2 to optimize performance, security, and efficiency.
2. **Research Publication**: Publish a detailed paper exploring web servers, their performance benchmarks, and best practices for effective use.
3. **Production-Ready Server**: Expand the project to create a fully functional, scalable web server that can be deployed in production environments, complete with proper handling of concurrency, load, and security.

## üéØ Project Goals

This project is primarily a **learning tool** and is not intended for immediate production use. However, if it garners significant community interest and development, it may evolve into a production-grade server. 

Though the project started in Python, as my knowledge of software engineering grows, I plan to incorporate other languages such as **Go**, **C**, and **JavaShit** to enhance functionality, performance, and versatility.
